            A limerick about Jaden
        </h3>

        There once was a young man who only ate.<br>
        You could probably use food as some bait!<br>
        It was quite profuse,<br>
        But we had no clues<br>
        To when his eating would reach its end date!<br>

        <br>

            Biography:
        </h3>
        <p>
            He loves food and he says his favorite is a hot dog. He has a few friends. I am one of them. I also made up a rhyme. It goes like this: Jaden is the bean, leo is mean, and I am lean.
